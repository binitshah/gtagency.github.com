We are the Agency. We are the Undergraduate Automated Intelligence Research organization at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech.

## Goals

We are, first and foremost, an organization that aims to learn. We are undergraduate students who attempt to tackle incredibly difficult problems. We don't always succeed, but we enjoy the process and learn from it.

That sounds a bit intimidating, but it shouldn't. Our club is designed to cater to everyone, from the officers or graduate students who want to work on open research topics, to first semester freshmen who have never written code before, much less a program or system that attempts to solve real world problems.

## Methods

We tackle this by meetings twice a week. No, they are not mandatory, but we love when people show up. Our Wednesday meetings are interactive lectures. Officers, advanced club members, and even professors will come and talk about topics of interest. These can range from basic concepts in Intellgience to a professor's current area of research. 

Unlike lectures, these are often interactive, with problems posed and solved, code written interactively by members. We hate boring lectures as much as anyone.

The other meeting is our work session. These are weekly meetings that generally last 1-2 hours, but when we're having a good time they have been known to last 6 or 8. At these meetings we build our projects. Each semester we take on a project for our members to work on, and we additionally have some larger projects, such as our ongoing autonomous vehicle project. Members are allowed to work on these in any capacity they can, whether that is watchig in awe or contributing large portions of a project. Our hope is that no matter where you start, you end up contributing something major.
