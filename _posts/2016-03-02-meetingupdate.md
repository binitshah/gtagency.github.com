This week at the Agency we'll be meeting to work on our project in CCB 346 at 6:00! We will be working to clean up our newly formed RNNs to see if we can get them to output cleaner and more fuller sonnets. This Wednesday in CCB 345 at 6:30 we will be finishing off our three part series on analyzing the MNIST dataset; this time through the lense of recurrent neural networks. As always, pizza and drinks will be provided...see you then!
