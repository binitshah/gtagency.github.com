This week at The Agency, we will be having our usual project meeting on Tuesday in CCB 346 at 6:00pm to work on getting ROS started for the car project. On Wednesday we'll be meeting in CCB 345 at 6:30pm for pizza, drinks, and a talk about randomized optimization. You find the slides for this week's lecture [here!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PECP3K33LWwpAc1IaEfu65kqin_7L17wYY8HocvO14U/edit#slide=id.p)
