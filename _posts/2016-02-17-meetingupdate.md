This week with The Agency we'll be meeting on Tuesday in CCB 346 at 6:00 until whenever to get TensorFlow set up and start working on building an RNN for our project! On Wednesday we'll be meeting at 6:30 in CCB 345 to talk about Bayes Inference and how we can apply it to classification tasks like handwriting recognition! It'll be super interesting and there will be free pizza and soda! We can't wait to see you!
