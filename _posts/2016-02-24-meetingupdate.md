Join us this week on Tuesday for our project meeting at 6:00 in CCB 346 where we'll continue setting up our RNN! If you get a chance, take a look at the Tensorflow tutorials so that you're familiar with the program before we get together. This Wednesday we will be continuing a three part series on solving MNIST...this time using softmax regression! As ususal, pizza and drinks will be provided.

If you can't make it to the meeting or want to follow along, the slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hJ7KB6pyulY3ksxoVLtJE1m0aRuZa-4cK_EEZfyD3mw/edit?usp=sharing)!
