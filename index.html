greeting: The Georgia Tech undergraduate AI research organization at the College of Computing.

We are, first and foremost, an organization that aims to learn. We are undergraduate students who attempt to tackle incredibly difficult problems. We don't always succeed, but we enjoy the process and learn from it.

That sounds a bit intimidating, but it shouldn't. Our club is designed to cater to everyone, from the officers or graduate students who want to work on open research topics, to first semester freshmen who have never written code before, much less a program or system that attempts to solve real world problems.
