Our past projects:


 - Ongoing
  - Buzzmobile, our autonomous car project. This was the Agency's founding project. It has gone through a number of iterations and its scale has increased since the club's founding.
  - IARRC, the International Autonomous Robot Racing Competition. We were brought on to improve the software for one of the Robojacket's projects, the bot performed admirably, and we are taking our lessons learned and tying them back into Buzzmobile.

 - 2015 Academic Year
  - Tetris-Bot, we competed amongst ourselves to see which group, the java-enthusiasts or the pythonistas, could build the better tetris-playing agent in the [the AI Block Battle](http://theaigames.com/competitions/ai-block-battle).
