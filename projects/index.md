Our past projects:


 - Ongoing
  - [Buzzmobile](https://github.com/gtagency/buzzmobile), our autonomous car project. This was the Agency's founding project. It has gone through a number of iterations and its scale has increased since the club's founding.
  
 - 2016 Academic Year
  - [Natural language processing experiments](https://github.com/gtagency/newage-lateral-piping), with the goal of having an agent successfully answer analogy questions
  - [Neural Network Hyperparameter Optimization](https://github.com/gtagency/nn-hyper-octopus), to understand how neural networks work, and how we can make them work better

 - 2015 Academic Year
  - Tetris-Bot, we competed amongst ourselves to see which group, the [java-enthusiasts](https://github.com/gtagency/tetris-java) or the [pythonistas](https://github.com/gtagency/tetris-python), could build the better tetris-playing agent in the [the AI Block Battle](http://theaigames.com/competitions/ai-block-battle).
   - IARRC, the International Autonomous Robot Racing Competition. We were brought on to improve the software for one of the Robojacket's projects, the bot performed admirably, and we are taking our lessons learned and tying them back into Buzzmobile.
